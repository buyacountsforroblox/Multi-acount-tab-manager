Calculates optimal grid layout (rows × columns)

Each window is sized to 800×600 pixels

Windows are arranged with calculated gaps between them

Memory trim is performed after tiling

Maintenance Cycles
Normal Mode (Auto every 5 minutes)
Pre-delay: 350ms before sending ESC

ESC delay: 350ms between ESC sends

ESC count: 2 per client

Stagger: 40-120ms between clients

Fast Mode (F4 or auto "fast" flag)
Pre-delay: 80ms

ESC delay: 120ms

ESC count: 2 per client

Metric	Description
Active	Number of running Roblox clients
Unstable	Clients with high resource usage or issues
Avg CPU	Average CPU usage across all clients
Avg RAM	Average RAM usage across all clients
